# Automated-Traffic-Management-System-using-openCV-in-Python

This is an Automated Traffic Mangement System.
It uses openCV in python. 
A combination of Haar Cascades and Trackers is used to make the system robust. The implementations of  Haar Cascade and the tracker have been used directly from openCV 3.1.0. The algorithm analyses the result using Haar Cascades and tracker for every frame. The result from the previous frame is also fed as an input for the current frame.
The algorithm is designed so as to minimise computation and maximise accuracy. The same modified tracker can be used for any object.
